    "This document is a detailed guide to using the `svgling` package; `svgling` is primarily a python tree-drawing package, aimed at linguists and computer scientists who want to draw constituent trees. It is tailored specifically towards rendering trees in Jupyter, but can be used for programmatically generating SVG and HTML tree diagrams in general -- one major external interface for doing this is via the [nltk package](https://www.nltk.org/). Beyond SVG constituent trees, `svgling` additionally supports a number of other diagram features useful to linguists, and it supports easy exporting to raster images."

    "## Background: SVG formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "Many options through this document interact with SVG formatting, via arguments pass to the `svgwrite` API. I won't specify the details of this here, see [the `svgwrite` docs](https://svgwrite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for details. Generally, `svgwrite` formatting parameters are validated and passed transparently through to svg itself with the python `_` character turned into `-`, so for details of how svgwrite parameters are interpreted, also see the SVG specification (and whatever viewer-specific documentation there is - not all SVG renderers are alike). I have generally not passed through all parameters, but rather chosen a few that I think are the most useful. Two key parameters that show up repeatedly for lines are `stroke` (which gets filled in with a color or `none`) and `stroke_width` (which gets filled in with a measurement, usually in user units for `svgling` trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Units**: SVG uses CSS-style units, which can be a little confusing. Here's a quick reference primer on the ones that will come up in this manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `user units`: the default internal unit of an SVG diagram. For svgling trees, at their default sizing, `1` is equivalent to `1px`. However, trees may be resized depending on the display context.\n",
    "* `px`: stands for \"pixel\", but does not necessarily correspond literally to a pixel in CSS; the interpretation is more abstract. The increment `1px` corresponds to an optical reference unit that is the smallest object likely to be visible on a screen. Some but not all displays can render objects that are less than `1px`.\n",
    "* `em`: the height of one line of text, at the current font size, from baseline to baseline.\n",
    "* `%`: percentage of the immediately containing SVG box.\n",
    "* `pt`: a unit inherited from print typography, but again in CSS this is interpreted kind of abstractly and won't really correspond to any reliable physical distance (what you might expect from the history). Not recommended for screen-oriented rendering. For css and svg, `1pt = 0.75px` (so `12pt = 16px`, for the most useful special case).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nodes and constituents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nodes**: A tree node is (for now) just a string. This string may span multiple lines, which are separated by `\\n`. For example: `\"N\\ncat\"` gives a two-line node with `N` as the first line and `cat` as the second. Within a node, multiple lines are anchored at the middle (leading to centering). A label consisting of the empty string `\"\"` is considered empty, and will not render at all -- the lines will be joined in the middle of the row height. If you want a blank label, any sequence of whitespace will work, e.g. `\" \"`."

    "**Selecting nodes and constituents**: For various purposes discussed throughout this manual, you can select particular parts of a tree (usually nodes or constituents) for formatting. To do this, you use what is sometimes called a **tree path**. These are sequences of indices that traverse the tree from the root node by choosing a daughter in left-to-right order. Indices begin at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, the path `(0,1,1)` gives the second daughter of the second daughter of the first daughter of the root node. The empty path `()` gives the subtree headed at the root. As this example illustrates, a path needn't be complete, and for annotation purposes will typically be interpreted as selecting an entire constituent, though for some purposes it may select a node. As a reminder, a length 1 path written as a tuple will require a comma so that python can disambiguate it from just a regular number in parenthesis, e.g. `(0,)`. A path that selects a daughter node whose index is greater than the number of daughters at that point in the tree is invalid. Using negative indices is possible, and these will be interpreted like negative indices in python: e.g. `-1` selects the rightmost node, etc.\n",

    "**Vertical layout**: A node at depth $n$ (where the root node of the tree is depth $0$) is positioned vertically in a line with all other nodes of depth $n$. Exception (see below for examples): if `leaf_nodes_align` is set to true, any leaf nodes are aligned with the lowest level of the tree, rather than depth they would otherwise be at. Within a row, vertical space is allowed for the tallest node at that depth; positioning of shorter nodes at that depth is configurable. Vertical spacing is calculated/generated in *em*s.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Horizontal layout**: The horizontal position of daughter nodes relative to a parent is determined by a (configurable) algorithm, usually based on some measure of the size of the daughter nodes. By default, this algorithm estimates the max text width taken up by the parent node label or the width of daughter nodes (and their daughters, etc). See below for examples of other options. No node will be positioned vertically below a node that does not dominate it. There is also a configurable padding parameter. Horizontal spacing is calculated initially in estimated *em*s, but (canvas width aside) is converted to percentages for svg layout. Because `svgling` does not do multi-pass rendering, it uses heuristics for glyph width rather than accurately calculating glyph width. (To do this, you'd basically need to render to a device, and see what happens.)\n",

The limitations are detailed below, but the main one to know about is that these trees do not support branching greater than binary. As with the rest of this package, the hybrid layout techniques are single-pass and make do without any javascript. The rendering techniques require up-to-date and recent browsers. At the moment, these trees are less intended for direct instantiation and more intended for programmatic use.\n",

    "\n",
    "To convert generated `svg` images to other formats both raster and vector, you have many options, both interactive and not. Sometimes the quickest option to get a raster image is simply to use your OS's screenshot tool, e.g. on mac, Shift+⌘+4 (and then select a screen region). For a more structured approach, `svgling` provides builtin support for doing format conversion via the [`cairosvg`](https://cairosvg.org/) package if it's installed. The `svgling.utils` module provides a light wrapper for `cairosvg`'s `svg2png`, `svg2pdf`, and `svg2ps` that take any IPython svg-rendering object as their first argument, and otherwise have the same api as the corresponding `cairosvg` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If `write_to` is set, these functions will write to a file; otherwise they return a byte object. For the `svgling.utils.svg2png(..)` function, the returned object is conveniently compatible with `IPython.display.Image` for display in Jupyter frontends, as in the example below.\n",
    "* They take various parameters including `scale`, `height`, `width`, `dpi`, etc.\n",
    "* See the [cairosvg documentation](https://cairosvg.org/documentation/) for details on other named parameters that these functions accept.\n",
    "* **Warning:** one point of SVG images is that they are vector images, and therefore will appear as crisp as possible at all resolutions. This is not true of raster images! It's recommended that you render to raster at a high enough resolution that the DPI can match whatever display device is intended. For embedding in other vector formats, for example PDF via LaTeX, conversion using `svg2pdf` may be more appropriate than raster conversion."
